# First Homework

## This homework is mainly focused on the following topics:

* **`Gradient Descent`** as an optimzation method.

* **`Estimation`** and **`Linear Regression`**.

* **`Overfitting`** and **`Underfitting`**.

* Performance of a predictive model: **`Accuracy`**, **`Precision`**, and **`Recall`**.





## Codes and report
* Seventh and sixth problems of this homework has been implemented utilizing **`python`** codes.

* In problem six, I have implemented a python code in order to **`classify`** images of two football teams, Chelsear and Manchester united, based on the average colors of all pixes an image.

* In the problem seven, I have employed polynomial regressors in order to provide an approximation for $$cos(2 \pi x)$$ function. Moreover, by applying polynomials of order 4, 8, 12, and 20, the underfitting and overfitting have been investigated as well.

* The sixth and seventh problem codes are provided in [p_6.py]() and [p_7.py].

* The assignment and my report are available in [assignment_1.pdf]() [Report.pdf]().

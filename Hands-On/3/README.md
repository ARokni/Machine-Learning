# Third Hands-on

This section is mainly focused on building a predictive model to figure out the chance of survival for each passanger based on particular features.

## Topics

* Data preperation
    
    - **`Cleaning Data`**

    - **`Imbalanced Classification`** problem

    - **`Data Visualization`**

* Classification
    
    -   **`Logistic Regression`**

    -   **`Confusion Matrix`**

    -   **`Accuracy`**, **`Sensitivity`**, **`Specificity`**, **`Precision`**, and **`Recall`**.

    -   Plot **`ROC`**.

# Second Homework

## This homework is mainly focused on the following topics:

* **`Generalize Linear Regression`**

* **`Bayesian Decision Theory`**

* **`Bayesian Classifier`**

* **`Optimal Classifier`**

* **`Minimum Risk Classification`**

* **`Neyman-Pearson Criterion`**

* **`Discriminant Functions`**

* **`Discriminability`** : **`ROC`** curve.


## Codes and Report

* In the seventh problem, I have implemented **Generalized Linear Regression** on **`nyc_cyclist_counts`** in order to forcast the number of cyclists depending on daily temperature and humidity. The codes are provided in [P_7]().

* In the eightth problem, I have implemented a **python** code utilizing **`numpy`** on **`Iris Dataset`** in order to:

    - **`Preprocess`** the data(**`Normalization`**, **`Z-Score`**).
    - Slecet the **best pair of features** for **classification**.
    - Provide a classifier with **`Nearest Centroid`** algorithm.
    - Evaluate the model performance utilizing **`Confusion Matrix`**, **`F1-Score`**, and **`Accuracy`**.

The codes are provided in [P_8]().

* In the nineth problem, I have implemented **`Naive-Bayes calssifier`** and **`Optimal-Bayes classifier`** utilizing **numpy** on **`Tiny Mnist`** and **`Noisy Moons`**. The codes are provided in [p_9]().

* In the tenth problem , I have implemented **`Logistic Regression`** utilizing **numpy** on [**random_dataset**](). Since there are more than two classes in the dataset, I employed **`One Vs Rest`** method to implement my classifier. The codes are provided in [P_10]().

* In the eleventh problem, I have implemented **`Logistic Regression`** utilizing python packages on [**quality_test**]() dataset. Sine the data is not **`Linearly Seperable`**, I had implemented a trnsformation in order to transfomr the data to a higher-dimensional space. In the new space, the transformed data can be easily seperated utilizing **Logistic Regression**. The codes are provided in [P_11]()

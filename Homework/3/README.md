# Third Homework

## This homework is mainly focused on the following topics:

* **`Gaussian Mixture Model`**

* **`Expectation Maximization`**

* **`Maximum Likelihood Estimation`**

* **`Maximum a Posteriori Estimation`**


## Codes and Report

* In the seventh problem, I have implemented **`Expectation Maximization`** to provide a **`Gaussian Mixture Model`** uitlizing **`numpy`** for **`Image Classification`** on [**Manchester-Chelsea**](https://github.com/ARokni/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Homework/3/Problem%207/Manchester_Chelsea) dataset. Moreover, I have investigated the appropriate hyperparameter (numbr of **kernels**) uitlizing **`AIC`** and **`BIC`**. The codes are provided in [p_7](https://github.com/ARokni/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Homework/3/Problem%207/P7.ipynb) notebook.


* In the eightth problem, I have implemented **Gaussian Mixture Model** code utilizing **`scikit-learn`** on [**Penguin Dataset**](https://github.com/ARokni/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Homework/3/Problem%208/penguins.csv) in order to:

    - Slecet the **best pair of features** for **classification**.
    - Determine the best number of **Kernels** based on **AIC** and **BIC**.

The codes are provided in [P_8](https://github.com/ARokni/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Homework/3/Problem%208/P8.ipynb) notebook.

* In the nineth problem, I have implemented **`Density Estimation`** task utilizing **Gaussian Mixture Model** via **numpy** on [**Moons**](https://github.com/ARokni/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Homework/3/Problem%209/moons.csv). The codes are provided in [P_9](https://github.com/ARokni/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Homework/3/Problem%209/P9.ipynb) notebook.


* The assignment and my report are available in [Files](https://github.com/ARokni/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Homework/2/Files).

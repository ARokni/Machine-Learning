# Fourth Homework

## This homework is mainly focused on the following topics:

* **`Non-Parametric Density Estimation`**:

    -   **`KNN`**

    -   **`Parzen Window`**

* **`Feature Selection`**

    -   **`Forward Selection`**

    -   **`Backward Elimination`**

    -   **`Heuristic Search`**

    -   **`PCA`**

    -   **`LDA`**: **`Fisher Linear Discriminant`**

    -   **`ICA`**   



## Codes and Report

* In the eightth problem, I have implemented **`PCA`** to provide most effective features of images. Then, I employed a **KNN** classifier for an **`Image Classification`** task utilizing the effective features. The codes are provided in [P_8]() notebook.

* In the nineth problem, I employed **`Naive-Bayes Classifier`** and **`Forward Selection`** algorithm on **`Tiny-Mnist`** in order to obtain the most effective features. The codes are provided in [P_9]() notebook.

* In the tenth problem, I implemented **LDA**  utilizing **`Numpy`** on [**Faces Dataset**](https://github.com/ARokni/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Homework/3/Problem%208/penguins.csv) in order to obtain the most effective features. Then I utilzied a **`Naive-Bayes`** classifier for the classification task. The codes are provided in [P_10]() notebook.

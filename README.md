## Final Project

In this project I have implemented  **`Detection Parkinson's Disease`** task utilizing  **`Discriminative`**, **`Generative`**, and **`Ensemble-Learning`** classifiers: *`KNN`**, **`Logistic Regression`**, **`Decision Tree`**, **`SVM`**, **`Radial Basis Functions`**, 
**`Multilayer Perceptron`**, **`Parzen Window`** and **Bayesian Decision Making**,  **`K-Nearest Neighbors`**  and **Bayesian Decision Making**, and **`Gaussian Mixture Models`** and **Bayesian Decision Making**. Moreove, various pre-processing and dimensionality reduction methods have been investigated:  **`LDA`**, **`ICA`**, **`PCA`**, **`Sequential Backward Feature Elimination`**, and  **`Autoencoders`**.
